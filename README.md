# 🛒 Residence Life Cart Management System

## 📖 Overview
The Cart Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the chaotic move-in day process for Resident Assistants (RAs) and residents. It replaces the manual, paper-based checkout process with an automated, real-time tracking system. 

By digitizing the checkout process, this system enforces time limits, prevents cart hoarding, and gives RAs a clear, real-time dashboard of inventory.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Resident Intake Form:** Quick QR-code accessible form for residents to claim a cart.
* **Automated Countdown:** Built-in 30-minute timer for each checkout session.
* **Real-Time RA Dashboard:** Live tracking of "Available," "In-Use," and "Overdue" carts.
* **SMS Notifications (Planned):** Automated text reminders sent to residents at the 25-minute mark and when time is up.
* **Secure Return Verification:** System-generated PINs given to residents by the RA to successfully close out a session.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)
* **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript (or React.js)
* **Backend & Database:** Firebase Realtime Database
* **Integrations:** Twilio API (for SMS)
